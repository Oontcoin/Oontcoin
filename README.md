### Oontcoin
Oontcoin is an experimental digital currency build on DASH that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Oontcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Ubicoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

We built this coin with the aim of opening up jobs like miners, traders, and many other sources of income. Our team consists of volunteers who support the success of this project even though it will take a long time, but we are fully convinced that one day we will be one of the candidates to replace Bitcoin.

Our goal is also to offer a second train to those who missed the first. A faster and more efficient.

We thus hope, in the long term, to balance the dominance of certain cryptocurrencies.

Any improvement is welcome.
